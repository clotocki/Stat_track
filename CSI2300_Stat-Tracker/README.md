Project name: CSI2300 Stat-Tracker

Team name: Tankers

Team Members: Colin Lotocki & Luke Orow

Our project will be a database that allows users to hold the statistics of basketball players for any variety league. Users will be able to add players into the database, check on and edit their stats, and see who is leading in certain stat categories. We decided to build this project because we both share a common intrest in sports. In basketball, player stats are an important part of the game. Our project would allow us to more easily track the stats of any league. On top this personal use, any basketball league could use this database to track their players as well, from major leagues like the NBA to small rec leagues. 


This project should take some time and effort the become fully realized. However, we have learned all the tools necissary to make this database a reality and should be running within 2 weeks
